## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r echo = TRUE}
library(dplyr) # for preprocessing

### Per the assignment instructions:
# 1. Load the data (i.e. `read.csv()`)
# 2. Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for
# your analysis
activity <- 
    read.csv("Reproducible Research/PeerAssessment1/activity.csv") %>% 
    filter(!is.na(steps))
activity.steps.grouped <- group_by(activity, date)
activity.steps.summary <- summarise(activity.steps.grouped, sum = sum(steps))

```



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r echo = TRUE}

library(ggplot2)

### Per the assignment instructions:
# 1. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

p.steps <- ggplot(data = activity.steps.summary, aes(x = sum)) + 
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000, 
                   col = "blue", 
                   aes(fill = ..count..)) +
    scale_fill_gradient("Count", low = "brown", high = "orange") +
    labs(title = "Histogram for Steps Taken Each Day") +
    labs(x = "Steps Taken in One Day (Binwidth of 1000 Steps)", y = "Day Count") +
    xlim(c(0, 22000))
p.steps

# 2. Calculate and report the **mean** and **median** total number of
# steps taken per day

centrality.steps <- summarise(activity.steps.summary, mean = mean(sum), median = median(sum))
centrality.steps

```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r echo = TRUE}
# 1. Make a time series plot (i.e. `type = "l"`) of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

activity.interval.grouped <- group_by(activity, interval)
activity.interval.summary <- summarise(activity.interval.grouped, mean = mean(steps))
p.interval <- ggplot(data = activity.interval.summary, aes(x = interval, y = mean)) +
    geom_line(color = "blue") +
    labs(title = "Time Series of Steps Averaged Across All Days per Interval") +
    labs(x = "Interval", y = "Average Steps")
p.interval

# 2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
maximum.steps <- subset(activity.interval.summary, mean == max(activity.interval.summary$mean))
maximum.steps$interval

```


## Imputing missing values

```{r echo = TRUE}

### Note that there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing
# values (coded as `NA`). The presence of missing days may introduce
# bias into some calculations or summaries of the data.
# 1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset 
# (i.e. the total number of rows with `NA`s)

activity.with.na <- 
    read.csv("Reproducible Research/PeerAssessment1/activity.csv")
nrow(activity.with.na[is.na(activity.with.na$steps), ])


# 2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. 
# The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the
# mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.
# 3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the 
# missing data filled in.
activity.with.na
df <- transform(activity.with.na, steps = ifelse(is.na(steps), 
activity.interval.summary[activity.interval.summary$interval == activity.with.na$interval, ],
steps))

# imputing mean values:
# Give mutate() the whole df including NAs,
# replace value of steps IF steps is NA, ELSE leave steps alone.
# Get the replacement value from the earlier interval means df. 
# Trick is to match interval means df to whole df interval by index, using row_number().
# This is confusing to read due to my explicit variable names, 
# so here is a logical rendition of that middle term in the ifelse():
### mean.df$mean[mean.df$interval == full.df$interval[row_number()]]

activity.imputed <- mutate(activity.with.na, steps = ifelse(is.na(steps),
    activity.interval.summary$mean[
        activity.interval.summary$interval == 
            activity.with.na$interval[row_number()]], 
    steps))

# 4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and 
# Calculate and report the **mean** and **median** total number of steps taken 
# per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of 
# the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates 
# of the total daily number of steps?


```


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
