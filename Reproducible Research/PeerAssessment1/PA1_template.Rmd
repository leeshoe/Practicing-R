## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
library(dplyr) # for preprocessing
# library(lubridate) # may need... for casting date variable in a way that is compatible with dplyr
activity <- read.csv("Reproducible Research/PeerAssessment1/activity.csv") %>% filter(!is.na(steps))
# activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date, "%Y-%m-%d")
activity$date <- as.POSIXct(activity$date, "%Y-%m-%d")

```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
