## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r echo = TRUE}
library(dplyr) # for preprocessing
library(lubridate) # may need... for casting date variable in a way that is compatible with dplyr

# testing different approaches to grouping.

# version 1 converts date from factor to date.
activity <- 
    read.csv("Reproducible Research/PeerAssessment1/activity.csv") %>% 
    mutate(date = parse_date_time(date,"%Y-%m-%d")) %>% 
    filter(!is.na(steps))
activity.grouped <- group_by(activity, date)

# version 2 leaves date as factor. 
activity2 <- 
    read.csv("Reproducible Research/PeerAssessment1/activity.csv") %>% 
    filter(!is.na(steps))
activity2.grouped <- group_by(activity, date)

# both execute w/o error. which is correct?
# summarise() returns identical results for both. I'll probably do w/o the parse.
```



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
